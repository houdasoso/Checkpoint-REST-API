# Checkpoint-REST-API
#  REST API with Node.js, Express, Mongoose & Postman

This is a simple and functional RESTful API project built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **Mongoose** to manage a user collection in a MongoDB database. It includes full CRUD operations and is tested using **Postman**.

##  Project Goals

This project was created as part of a checkpoint exercise. The goals were to:

- Set up a Node.js backend project.
- Connect it to MongoDB (local or Atlas) using Mongoose.
- Create a user model using Mongoose schemas.
- Implement REST API routes for **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** (CRUD).
- Test all endpoints using **Postman**.
